## 1. Importance of Moose in the Timber Supply Area
Moose (*Alces alces*)are a highly valued wildlfie species in British Columbia.  

In addition, any relevant management plans, policies, regulations or best practices that are being implemented or considered to address each wildlife issue will be summarized. 

At a minimum this includes contacting regional government wildlife biologists, government foresters and First Nations  to discuss issues. 


Moose are a highly valued wildlfie species in British Columbia.  

Moose are an important, nutritious, staple food of many interior and coastal First Nations communities in British Columbia [First Nations Health Authority fact sheet](https://www.fnha.ca/Documents/Traditional_Food_Fact_Sheets.pdf). Moose are also currently a culturally important species to many First Nations, for example, moose hide is a key symbol in a First Nations led campaign to end domestic violence in Canada ( [Moose Hide Campaign](https://moosehidecampaign.ca/home/about-us)). Annually, approximately 40,000 moose hunting licenses are sold, with typically over 250,000 days spent moose hunting [Kuzyk 2016](https://alcesjournal.org/index.php/alces/article/download/155/199).

## 2. Key Relationships Between Moose and Forestry   


Moose in the central interior of British Columbia, south of Prince George, avoided roads, particularly in highly roaded areas, but appear to select for large areas with intermeidate levels of forest harvest ( [Schneideman 2018](http://web.unbc.ca/~michael/Pubs/Matt%20Scheideman%20Thesis%20Final%20for%20distribution.pdf)). However, at a finer scale, moose in general avoided older (16 to 40 year old) cutblocks, but repsonse to culbocks was ambigous across differetn areas adn seasons ( [Schneideman 2018](http://web.unbc.ca/~michael/Pubs/Matt%20Scheideman%20Thesis%20Final%20for%20distribution.pdf)). 


At a fine scale (over a period of a day to a week), moose were more likely to be killed by hunters in areas with higher road densiites and new cutblocks( [Mumma and Gillingham 2019](http://web.unbc.ca/~michael/Mumma_and_Gillingham_2019.pdf)). 


While cuytblokcs have gerenally been considered positive for moose, by removing forest canpoty that realeses shrub forage preferred by moose, soem recent evdinece suggest this may not always be the case. At large scales (over a period of 180 days to a year), moose were found to more likely starve to death in areas with higher road and cutblock densites ( [Mumma and Gillingham 2019](http://web.unbc.ca/~michael/Mumma_and_Gillingham_2019.pdf)). Recent work south of Prince George has indicated that shrubs in open areas of large cutblocks may provide limteed protein value for moose, espeically comarped ot shrubs along cutblock edges and in adajcent forest ( [J. Werner, FLNRORD WIldlefi Biolgoist, pers. comm.](https://video.unbc.ca/media/The+abundance+of+scarcityA+landscape+change%2C+protein+limitation%2C+and+moose+population+dynamics+in+north-central+BC.+Dr.+kJeff+Werner%2C+BC+Ministry+of+Forests%2C+Lands%2C+Natural+Resource+Operations%2C+and+Rural+Development+-+October+18+2019/0_pbu2wpdw/19801)).

## 3. Forestry-related Indicators of Moose Habitat and Populations

- road density indicator; thrsholds?
- kill per unit effort (KPUE): can be an index of poplation density, particulalry where there is more road access [Kuzym et al. 2018](http://alcesjournal.org/index.php/alces/article/download/240/274)
- forest age distribtuion?
