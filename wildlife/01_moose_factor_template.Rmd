## 1. Importance of Moose in the Timber Supply Area

- provide some context on why moose are beign highlighted for this AAC determination 
  - use some of the high-level information provided in the 00_widlife_README.rmd, but also provide local context, for example, provide information on huntign statistics, or habitat enhancement initieives to help quantify the improtance of moose in the TSA
- in particular, and perhaps most important, if information is available, emphasize why moose are improtant to First Nations communities in the TSA

## 2. Key Relationships Between Moose and Forestry   

- summarize some of the high-level information provided in the 00_widlife_README.rmd
- where possible, add local context on moose-forestry realtionships, for example, results of reaserch on moose conudcted in or near the TSA
- include a summary of any First Nations knowledge and data on moose, where available and permitted to do so

## 3. Forestry-related Indicators of Moose Habitat and Populations

- identify and explain the indicators used in the analysis and why they are important to moose management

## 4. Current State of Moose Habitat and Populations in the Timber Supply Area

- summarize and visualize indicators on moose poplations, inclduing, for example:
  - maps of current moose density or kills per unit effort (KPUE) at the wildlife management unit (WMU) scale
  - trend in moose density or KPUE in the region where the TSA occurs
  - maps of current raod density across the TSA at landscape unit (LU) or freshwater assessment watershed area (AWA) scales
  - frequency or box plot showing distribtuion of road density across LU's or AWA's 
  - maps of prportion of 5 to 30 year old forest stand across the TSA at LU or AWA scales 
  - frequency or box plot showing distribtuion of 5 to 30 year old forest stands across LU's or AWA's
  - maps of proportion of greater than 80 year old forest stand across the TSA at LU or AWA scales 
  - frequency or box plot showing distribtuion of greater than 80 year old forest stands across LU's or AWA's
- the above are suggestions; these can be modified or alternatives can be used based on local knowledge or needs
- where available, use sumamries and visualtizatiosn of these indciators to show thresholds, limits or risk to moose habtiat and popualtions  
- in addition, sumamrize and visualize any First Nations knowledge and data, where available and permitted to do so

## 5. Moose Habitat and Population Management Tools 

- describe any moose management tools that could be applied in the TSA (in addition to what has and is already being done)
- where relevant, describe any moose management scenarios applied in the TSR model to compare to the base case 
  - describe how the scenario(s) was applied in the TSR model (e.g., new constraints on timber harvest)

## 6. Simulated Future States of Moose Habitat and Populations Under Different Management Scenarios in the Timber Supply Area 

- summarize and visualize simulated future indicators of moose habitat under base case and alternative moose management scenarios 
  - maps of simulated future road density across the TSA at LU or AWA scales at 10 or 20 year intervals
  - frequency or box plot showing distribtuion of simulated road density across LU's or AWA's at 10 or 20 year intervals
  - maps of proportion of simulated future 5 to 30 year old forest stand across the TSA at LU or AWA scales at 10 or 20 year intervals
  - frequency or box plot showing distribtuion of simulated future  5 to 30 year old forest stands across LU's or AWA's at 10 or 20 year intervals
  - maps of proportion of greater than simulated future greater than 80 year old forest stand across the TSA at LU or AWA scales at 10 or 20 year intervals
  
- summarize and visualize simulated future AAC of moose management scearnios comapred to the base case
  - figure showing timber harvest flow under base case and alterantive moose management scenario(s)
