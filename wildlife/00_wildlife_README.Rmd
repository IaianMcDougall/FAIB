## Wildlife and Timber Supply Reviews
Here I document a standard approach for developing wildlife-specific 'factors' for timber supply reviews (TSRs). There is a need to effectively consider wildlife in TSRs and account for the effects of allowable annual cut (AAC) decisions on wildlife. In particular, recent court decisions in British Columbia (BC) have stated that statutory decision makers must use credible information to consider the effects of land management decisions, including AAC determinations, on Indigenous peoples rights to harvest wildlife (e.g., see [William v. British Columbia 2012](https://www.bccourts.ca/jdb-txt/CA/12/02/2012BCCA0285.htm) and [West Moberly First Nations v. British 2011](https://www.bccourts.ca/jdb-txt/CA/11/02/2011BCCA0247.htm)). Accommodations to First Nations communities for impacts of forest harvest on wildlife may be necessary as part of some AAC decisions. The approach described here is intended to support the creation of 'credible' information on the status of wildlife in a TSA for the Chief Forester to consider as part of AAC determinations. 

## Collaboration on Wildlife Analyses to Support Timber Supply Reviews
The standard approach described here is useful as a starting point for developign inforamtion on wildlife for TSR's. However, wildlife analyses to support the TSR process should be flexible, and deviations from this appraoch are encoruaged wehre they promote better inforamtion to supprt TSR. In aprtiacult, teh approach shoudl be modified where necessary to enhance collabroation with First Nations and icnrease their trust in teh inforamtion.Ultimately, wildlfie analyses shoudl wherever possible be developed in collabraotion with First Nations. 

In addition, I recommend these analyses are completed under advisement of regional wildlfei biolgoists. They will be able to provide imprtoant context on teh information, and to make recommendatiosn on how to adjust these anlyses so they are more appropraite to the local ecological conditions. For example, moose may respond to forestry activity differently across different regions beacuse of unique habtait conditions or aniaml behaviours. In addition, local biologists will likely haev imrptoatn insights on how forestry activity could be modified to improve habitat conditiosn for wildlfie species of interest. Thus, they can provide advice on alterantive management regimes that coudl be implemented as alterantive scenarios in timebr supply models to assess their potential imapct to timerb supply. 

## Wildlife Templates for Timber Supply Reviews
I provide standard templates for developing wildlife factors for TSR AAC determination meetings. I provide these templates as R markdown files (.rmd's) that document text and, where possible, functioning code to manipulate, analyze and visualize data to create wildlife factors. The templates do not necesarily have to be applied to every TSR process. They are not intended to be applied as strict and inflexible standards. Other approaches may be developed for a specific TSR if they are more appropriate, and in particular, if they are favoured by First Nations communities that are partnering in TSR processes. However, the templates are useful in the absence of those partnerships and to provide a starting point for developing wildlife factors for AAC determinations. 

The templates include six sections:
1. Importance of the Wildlife Species in the Timber Supply Area
2. Key Relationships Between the Wildlife Species and Forestry 
3. Forestry-related Indicators of the Wildlife Species' Habitat and Population Conditions
4. Current State of the Wildlife Species' Habitat and Populations in the Timber Supply Area
5. The Wildlife Species' Habitat and Population Management Tools
6. Simulated Future States of the Wildlife Species Habitat and Populations Under Different Management Scenarios in the Timber Supply Area 

The intent of these sections are to descibe why the wildife species of interest is important in a timber supply area (TSA), how that species relates to forestry, the current status of the species in the TSA, management options for that species (relevant to forestry adn teh TSA), and simulated future status of the species under alternative forest management regimes.  

## Limitations Around Wildlife Indicators in Timber Supply Reviews
Prior to discussing which wildlife values to include in TSR, it is important to understand limitations around timber supply models and how they can be used to assess future conditions of wildlife habitat and populations. 

Wildlife habitat indicators should be estimated using commnly avaialble data that can be integrated with TSR. Thus, [vegetation resources inventory data](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/vri-2019-forest-vegetation-composite-rank-1-layer-r1-), and roads data from the [digital road atlas (DRA)](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/digital-road-atlas-dra-master-partially-attributed-roads) and [forest tenure roads](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/243c94a1-f275-41dc-bc37-91d8a2b26e10) are likely going to be the most appropriate datasets. These datasets can be used to calculate current habitat conditions, but estimating future conditions will be reliant on outputs from timber supply models. Specifically, future roads and forest stand characterisitcs will need to be estimated from timber supply models. 

The two key outputs of interest from timber suppyl models that are likely goign to be most relevant to wildlife habitat are forest stand characteristics and roads. Current standard practice for TSR models provides a limited number of outputs related to forest stands. They use estimates on stand vloume and hegith from tree or forest stand growth and yield models, specifcially, the variable density yield projection [VDYP](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/forest-inventory/growth-and-yield-modelling/variable-density-yield-projection-vdyp) model for natural origin stands and the [table interpolation program for stand yields (TIPSY)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/forest-inventory/growth-and-yield-modelling/table-interpolation-program-for-stand-yields-tipsy) model for managed stands. 

VDYP is limteid because

However, they can also provide information on stand age, height and canopy closure. All TSR models can provide outputs on forest stand age, as they all track annual time steps and when a stand is harvested. Wildlife indicators realted to stand age should tehrefore be realtively simple to integrate with timber supply models.  

Thus, wildlfie indcators will need to be realted to forest stand age, height adn canopy closure. 
----





Some timber supply models spatially simulate future roads, by connecting simualted future cutblocks to existing road networks. Thus, outputs from these models can be used to estimate future road indicators for moose. However, for models that do not simulate future roads, road densities can be estimated from cutblock densities at a landscape unit or watershed scale using a [statistical model](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/forestry/stewardship/forest-analysis-inventory/tsr-annual-allowable-cut/wildlife-analysis/road_cutblock_model_20161102.pdf). 

Anotehr imprtoatn consideation is that timber suppyl models are typically not designed to accruately spatially and temproally simualte the lcoation o future forest harvest. Therefore, spatial confuration fo outputs form timber supply models shoudl be usedd with caution. The more generalizable that model outputs are made saptially adn temporally, the more sueful the model outptus will be. I recommend sumamrzing forest stand and raod attribues at the landscape unit or watershed assessment area scales, over 10 or 20 year periods.  

## Wildlife Species of Relevance to Timber Supply Reviews
I developed standard templates for wildlife species that are likely to be of high management or conservation priority across TSAs and that have a clear connection to forestry development. The value of a particular wildlife species to First Nations and other communities can vary across BC. However, there are some species that cover large extents of BC and are generally highly valued across the province for conservation or socio-economic reasons. Another important consideration is the connection between the wildlife species and forestry. Obviously, AAC decisons are specific to forestry, and therefore, when considering the effects of the decison on wildlife, the focus should be on species that are clearly and strongly influenced by forestry. Based on these two criteria, I have identified three species to consider as part of TSRs. These include:
- Moose (*Alces alces*)
- Grizzly bear (*Ursus arctos horribilis*)
- Fisher (*Pekania pennanti*)

These three species have ranges that cover large extents of BC and they are all clearly and strongly influenced by forestry. The list may expand or change in the future, but for now these three species are a useful starting point for considaration in TSRs. Below I provide a more detailed rational for including each of these species in TSRs, which could be used to help develop a factor for these species in an AAC determination. A standard template for each of these species to support development of a TSR factor is also included in this folder. 

### Moose
Moose are widely distributed across the majority of BC, and are particularly abundant in the central interior and northern boreal mountains ( [Moose In British Columbia](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/moose.pdf)). They are typically a highly valued wildlife species in North America for a variety of cultural and economic reasons ( [Timmermann and Rogers 2005](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/55d2/86e83dd7cae6da270c153858b3d1a98d89de.pdf)). 

Prior to European colonization, moose were used extensively by Indigenous peoples for food, clothing and shelter ( [Moose In British Columbia](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/moose.pdf)). In the last 100 years, moose have become an important, nutritious, staple food of many interior and coastal First Nations communities in BC ( [First Nations Health Authority fact sheet](https://www.fnha.ca/Documents/Traditional_Food_Fact_Sheets.pdf)). First Nations have taken leadership roles in moose managment, for example, partnering with the government of BC to co-manage moose in the Chilcotin region, where moose population declines were of concern ( [Vancouver Sun 2018](https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/b-c-government-and-first-nation-sign-deal-to-manage-declining-moose-populations/). Moose are currently a culturally important species to many First Nations, for example, moose are a key symbol in a First Nations led campaign to end domestic violence in Canada ( [Moose Hide Campaign](https://moosehidecampaign.ca/home/about-us)).

Moose are a key game species in BC, for sustenance and as a trophy species ( [Moose In British Columbia](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/moose.pdf)). Annually, approximately 40,000 moose hunting licenses are sold in BC, with typically over 250,000 days spent moose hunting ( [Kuzyk 2016](https://alcesjournal.org/index.php/alces/article/download/155/199)). However, while these numbers are relatively stable, the number of succesfull hunts has been declining in the last 15 years, to approximately 6,000 licensed moose harvested annually across BC ( [Kuzyk 2016](https://alcesjournal.org/index.php/alces/article/download/155/199)). Moose also have significant non-consumptive value, as part of ecotourism and wildlife viewing ( [Moose In British Columbia](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/moose.pdf)). 

There is evidence of recent declining moose populations in many parts of BC. Moose population declines of approximately 20-40% occurred in the Omineca and Cariboo regions of British Columbia from 2008 to 2014 ( [Kuzyk 2016](https://alcesjournal.org/alces/index.php/alces/article/download/155/199)). More specifically, moose were declining in 25% of game management zones (GMZs) in BC from 1996 to 2005 and in 71% of GMZs from 2006-2015 ( [Kuzyk et al. 2018](http://alcesjournal.org/index.php/alces/article/download/240/274)). These declines triggered the implementation of a large research program in central BC to study causes of moose mortality ( [Kuzyk and Heard 2014](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/plants-animals-and-ecosystems/wildlife-wildlife-habitat/wildlife-health/wildlife-health-documents/2014_bc_moose_research_design.pdf); [Kuzyk 2016](https://alcesjournal.org/alces/index.php/alces/article/download/155/199)).

#### Relationship to Forestry
Research has shown that forestry activity influences moose density and distribution, both positively and negatively. Moose require a mix of forest cover types within their home ranges, and deciduous shrub and tree browse is a key forage element ( [Crete 1988](https://pubs.cif-ifc.org/doi/pdfplus/10.5558/tfc64246-3)), including species such as *Salix spp.*, *Populus tremuloides*, *Betula papyrifera*, *Corylus cornuta*, *Prunus pensylvanica*, *Amelanchier alnifolia* and *Cornus spp.* ( [Peek et al. 1976](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3830485?seq=1); [McNicol and Gilbert 1980](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/stable/pdf/3807966.pdf?ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-5055%2Ftest&refreqid=search%3A1f887ac9dfbe73bc019bed2593bcf800); [Poole and Stuart-Smith 2005](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kim_Poole/publication/259568012_FINE-SCALE_WINTER_HABITAT_SELECTION_BY_MOOSE_IN_INTERIOR_MONTANE_FORESTS/links/0c96052c8f313bbc3a000000/FINE-SCALE-WINTER-HABITAT-SELECTION-BY-MOOSE-IN-INTERIOR-MONTANE-FORESTS.pdf)). Forestry cutblocks remove forest canopy, which generally increases the production of deciduous shrub browse on landscapes, which can positively influence moose ( [Crete 1988](https://pubs.cif-ifc.org/doi/pdfplus/10.5558/tfc64246-3); [Leclerc et al. 2012](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/stable/pdf/23361352.pdf?ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-5055%2Ftest&refreqid=search%3A80dbc9cab1a0c6625f7492d10d952322)). Thus, the positive effects of forestry are related to the creation fo eraly seral forest habtiat, which favours the production of moose forage on a landscape. 

In general, the benefits of a forest cutblock to moose follows the succesional pattern of stand recovery. New cutblocks (less than 5 years old) can be of little use to moose ( [Eastman 1977](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0094631)), likely because it takes shrubs a few years to occupy and grow in a harvested area. Shrub production in forestry cutblocks varies, but appears to peak anywhere from at 5 to 30 years after harvest, and moose appear to use these stand types the most ( [Peek et al. 1976](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3830485?seq=1); [Crete 1977](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/x77-034); [Eastman 1977](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0094631); [Crete 1988](https://pubs.cif-ifc.org/doi/pdfplus/10.5558/tfc64246-3); [Leclerc et al. 2012](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/stable/pdf/23361352.pdf?ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-5055%2Ftest&refreqid=search%3A80dbc9cab1a0c6625f7492d10d952322)). Cutblocks older than 30 years old (i.e., mid-seral stands), appear to generally be of less forage value to moose ( [Peek et al. 1976](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3830485?seq=1); [Leclerc et al. 2012](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/stable/pdf/23361352.pdf?ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-5055%2Ftest&refreqid=search%3A80dbc9cab1a0c6625f7492d10d952322)) and thus receive less use ( [Schneideman 2018](http://web.unbc.ca/~michael/Pubs/Matt%20Scheideman%20Thesis%20Final%20for%20distribution.pdf)). 

The positive effects of cutblocks on moose forage may not be universal. For example, they can be diminished or lost when conifers are planted at high densities or thinning and herbicides are applied to limit the growth of deciduous vegetation on cutblocks ( [Peek et al. 1976](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3830485?seq=1); (https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/stable/pdf/23361352.pdf?ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-5055%2Ftest&refreqid=search%3A80dbc9cab1a0c6625f7492d10d952322)). In contrast, reducing the density of conifer plantations can benefit moose by promoting shrub growth. For example, thinning of lodgepole pine forests in the Penticton, Prince George and Kamloops areas of BC to approximately 500 stems/ha resulted in higher shrub volume and moose use in cutblocks compared to old stands, unthinned cutblocks or stands thinned at higher densities, i.e., 1,000 to 2,000 stems/ha  ( [Sullivan et al. 2007](https://appliedmammal.com/content/publications/FEM%20240%2032-41%202007.pdf). Recent reaserch in central BC, found that at large scales (over a period of 180 days to a year), moose were more likely starve to death in areas with higher road and cutblock densites ( [Mumma and Gillingham 2019](http://web.unbc.ca/~michael/Mumma_and_Gillingham_2019.pdf)), suggesting that the characteristics of forest harvest in those areas is providing no forage benefit to moose. Indeed, recent work south of Prince George has indicated that shrubs in open areas of large cutblocks may provide limited protein value for moose, especially compared to shrubs along cutblock edges and in adajcent mature and old forest ( [J. Werner, FLNRORD WIldlefi Biolgoist, pers. comm.](https://video.unbc.ca/media/The+abundance+of+scarcityA+landscape+change%2C+protein+limitation%2C+and+moose+population+dynamics+in+north-central+BC.+Dr.+kJeff+Werner%2C+BC+Ministry+of+Forests%2C+Lands%2C+Natural+Resource+Operations%2C+and+Rural+Development+-+October+18+2019/0_pbu2wpdw/19801)). Thus, not all cutblocks will be of equal forage value to moose, and how vegetation is managed in cutblocks plays a key role in determining that value.    
Older stands, including mature cutblocks, can also benefit moose by providing valuable cover habitat. Closed canpoy conifer forest is important habitat for providing thermal cover in summer and to intercept snow in high snowfall years or areas ( [Eastman 1977](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0094631); [Schwab 1985](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0097322#downloadfiles); [Crete 1988](https://pubs.cif-ifc.org/doi/pdfplus/10.5558/tfc64246-3); [Demarchi and Bunnell 1995](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fred_Bunnell/publication/279886949_Forest_cover_selection_and_activity_of_cow_moose_in_summer/links/59f656bb0f7e9b553ebd29ab/Forest-cover-selection-and-activity-of-cow-moose-in-summer.pdf)). 

Ultimately, a diversity of forest stand types is necessary to provide good habitat for moose ( [Eastman 1977](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0094631); [Schwab 1985](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0097322#downloadfiles)), and configuration of those stands is also important. Aggregation of uniform forest types will result in poor moose habitat. For example, [Leclerc et al. 2012](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/stable/pdf/23361352.pdf?ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-5055%2Ftest&refreqid=search%3A80dbc9cab1a0c6625f7492d10d952322) found that increasing aggregation of 15-30 year old harvested stands resulted in lower use of those areas of moose. Similarly, leaving laarge uncut areas adjacent to cutblocks (i.e., 'leave blocks') was found to be positively related to moose density ( [Eason 1989](http://flash.lakeheadu.ca/~arodgers/Alces/Vol25/Alces25_63.pdf)). To achieve a diversity of forest types, limits on cutblock size have been proposed and applied as part of moose management. For example, [Peek et al. 1976](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3830485?seq=1) proposed that cutblocks less than 80 ha in size were ideal for moose. However, [Rempel et al. 1997](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3802610?seq=1) found that a provincial moose habitat policy to maintain cutblock sizes less than 130 ha in Ontario did not result in higher moose densities. Landscapes with an intermediate level of forest harvest appear to be favoured by moose ( [Schneideman 2018](http://web.unbc.ca/~michael/Pubs/Matt%20Scheideman%20Thesis%20Final%20for%20distribution.pdf), and [Poole and Stuart-Smith 2006](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kim_Poole/publication/237973775_Winter_habitat_selection_by_female_moose_in_western_interior_montane_forests/links/0046351ef1db0e19df000000.pdf) recommended a configuration of 40-45% forage and 20-25% cover habitat to provide high quality winter habitat for moose. 

Forest harvest, when done in moderation and in a way that creates a complex configuration of forest stands, can benefit moose. However, the creation of road infrastrucutre to extract timber appears to neutralize those benefits and in some cases negatively affects moose density and distribution overall ( [Leclerc et al. 2012](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/stable/pdf/23361352.pdf?ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-5055%2Ftest&refreqid=search%3A80dbc9cab1a0c6625f7492d10d952322)). Forestry roads can make areas more accessible to moose hunters, increasing hunting mortality, which can limit moose population size ( [Eason 1989](http://flash.lakeheadu.ca/~arodgers/Alces/Vol25/Alces25_63.pdf)). [Rempel et al. 1997](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3802610?seq=1) found that modified harvest practices to create smaller cutblocks resulted in lower moose densities due to the higher associated road densities in those areas. Recent research in central BC found that moose avoided roads, particularly in highly roaded areas ( [Schneideman 2018](http://web.unbc.ca/~michael/Pubs/Matt%20Scheideman%20Thesis%20Final%20for%20distribution.pdf)). In addition, at a fine scale (over a period of a day to a week), moose were more likely to be killed by hunters when moving in areas with higher road densities and new cutblocks ( [Mumma and Gillingham 2019](http://web.unbc.ca/~michael/Mumma_and_Gillingham_2019.pdf)). A combination of newly open cutblocks accessible by road may be especially poor habitat for moose ( [Rempel et al. 1997](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3802610?seq=1)), as moose are likely highly vulnerable to hunters there due to a comibnation of accesibility and open site lines. 
Moose were foudn to much less frequenctly cross raods in areas with road densities of 0.2 km/km^2^ in summer and 0.4 km/km^2^ in witner ( [Beyer et al. 2013](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1365-2664.12042)). Similarly, [Frair et al. 2008](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01526.x) found that ek (*Cervus elaphus*) avoided adn wer less likely to survive in areas with road densities greater than 0.25 to 0.5 km/km^2^. A review of reawrch by by [Forman et al. (1997)](http://www.lauxen.net/conecte/referencias/Forman_1997a.pdf) suggested that large mammla popualtions decline once a threshodl of 0.6 km/km^2^ orads is surpassed. The overall effects of forestry on moose are likely neagtive when roads endure on the landscape and are not actively decommissioned or recovered ( [Leclerc et al. 2012](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/stable/pdf/23361352.pdf?ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-5055%2Ftest&refreqid=search%3A80dbc9cab1a0c6625f7492d10d952322)).     

Moose have an important and complex relationship with forestry development. Based on a review of previous research on the effects of forestry on moose, the relationship is most likely to be positive when:
- At the scale of a moose home range (i.e., approximately 10 km^2^), forest cutblocks are interspersed with large mature or old forest stands, and cut in a progressive way over a 5 to 10 year period so there is a distribution of cutblock ages 
- Silvicultural practices on harvested stands allow for growth of some shrubs, particularly along cutblock edges with mature stands   
- Roads are minimized, blocked, deactivated and restored

#### Indicators of Habitat and Populations
Within the context of the key moose-forestry relationships identified above, there are some potential indicators or constraints that could be implemented as part of TSA models, including: 
- the area of early, mid and later seral forest stands; for example, a dsitrbituion of 40% five to 30 year old cutbloks and 20% old forest with dense canpopy closure may be ideal targest for a landscape unit or watershed 
- raod density, for example, a threshold within a landscape unit or watershed 
- cutblock replanting stocking targets, for example, implementation of low density conifer stocking (low stems/ha) in areas where moose forage production is a priority 

In addition to these habitat indicators, it is useful to consider some moose popualtion indicators to provide context on moose status in a TSA. Where available, moose desnity estimaets shoudl be used. These are typically estimated using [aerial survey methods](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/natural-resource-stewardship/nr-laws-policy/risc/unga_ml20_final.pdf) within [wildlife managment units (WMUs)](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/wildlife-management-units). However, these data are not likely to be available across all WMUs within a TSA, and may not be recent. Thus, these data will likely provide an incomplete picture on moose popautlion status adn trend across a TSA over time, but are wroth considerign as they provide the most accurate estiamtes of moose popualtion abundance. Density data for a specific TSA can be searched for using the [species inventory web explorer (SIWE)](http://a100.gov.bc.ca/pub/siwe/search_reset.do) and the [wildlife species inventory (SPI) data](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/wildlife-species-inventory-results-by-area-all). In the absence of density data, kill per unit effort (KPUE) can be used as an index of population density, particulalry where there is more road access [Kuzyk et al. 2018](http://alcesjournal.org/index.php/alces/article/download/240/274). KPUE data is obtained annually form a sampel fo hutner surveys; this data is obtained from.... Gerry?

Moose use of habitat varies at the population to individual animal depending on animal behaviours and local habitat context ( [Eastman 1974](https://www.arlis.org/docs/vol2/hydropower/APA_DOC_no._1065.pdf); [Osko et al. 2004](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.library.ubc.ca/stable/pdf/3803391.pdf?ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-5055%2Ftest&refreqid=search%3A80dbc9cab1a0c6625f7492d10d952322); [Gillingham and Parker 2008](https://alcesjournal.org/alces/index.php/alces/article/download/33/32)). Thus, general indicators and constraints should be used with caution. I recommend discussing these indicators with regional and district government wildlife biolgists to customise them so they are appropirate to the local context.

#### Calculation of Indicators for Timber Supply Reviews
Once appropriate indicators have been established, they can be used to estimate the current state of moose popualtions and habitat in a TSA. As a stratign point for habtiat indicators, I recommend calcualting current road densities and the porportion of area of 5 to 30 year old and greater than 80 year old conifer stands by [ladnscape unit (LU)](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/landscape-units-of-british-columbia-current) and [freshwater assessment watershed area (AWA)](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/freshwater-atlas-assessment-watersheds). I also recommend summarizing records of silvicultural practices that were implemented (e.g., plantatition densities). Finally, I aslo recommend summarizing popualtion desnity and KPUE data, wehre availabile, includign most recent and 'hsitoric' (10 to 20 eyars ago) data. 

#### Management Tools and Constraints
Inforamtion on teh current state of moose popautliosn and habitat is useful and copudl be consdired sufficient for an AAC determination discussion. However, ideally it is valuable to assess future habtiat conditions under alterantive management scenarios. Habtiat indicators may be estimated in the future under a 'base case' timber supply sceanrio to assess how timber harvest might influence moose in teh future. Road and stand age outputs from TSR models can be used to update these indocatros over time. This provides an assessment of how forestry under current legislated constraints might infuence moose habitat in the future, and whether that is of concenr. 

If possible, future conditions under teh base case shodul be compared to some alternative managemnt sceanrios. This can provide valuabel inforamtion on how managment sceanrios designed for moose influnce timber supply, and thus how changes to AAC might infleucne moose. Howeverm, it is improtant to note that a redcution in AAC would not necessaily benefit a species such as mosse. These redcutions woudl have to be doen in combination with a direction on how forest harvest is coducnted (e.g., where adn when, inclduign limtis ). Alterantive managment sceanrios for moose could include applying new cotnraints (i.e., limits) on road density and forest age classes, and silvicutlrual prescriptions to specified areas where moose habtait improvements are deemed valuable or necessary. These areas could be LU's or AWA's idnetified as imprtoatn for miatnaing high moose densities.   














### Grizzly Bear
Grizzly bear are a focal wildlife management species in Canada and British Columbia because of their social, cultural and conservation value. Grizzly bear viewing and hunting are important economic and social components of British Columbia’s tourism and recreation industries [Environmental Reporting BC 2012](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/soe/indicators/plants-and-animals/grizzly-bears.html).




The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada lists them as species of [*Special Concern*](https://www.sararegistry.gc.ca/virtual_sara/files/cosewic/sr_ours_grizz_bear_1012_e.pdf) due to their high sensitivity to human-caused disturbance and mortality where roads facilitate access and human-bear interactions.	In British Columbia, they are blue listed (i.e., species of special concern because of characteristics that make them particularly sensitive to human activities or natural events) and have a S3 conservation status (i.e., rare and local, found only in a restricted range or susceptible to extirpation or extinction).




Grizzly bear are wide ranging species that use a variety of habitats for food and shelter. They are therefore influenced broadly, at large scales and by a variety of land uses. They are sometimes considered as “umbrella” or “indicator” species, meaning the status of their populations may be indicative of the status of other wildlife species or environmental values where they live.

## Engagement with First Nations
Ideally, the determination of priority wildlife species for assessment as part of TSRs should be done in collabortion with First Nations communities in the TSA or affected by the TSR decision. The information above can be used as a starting point to help inform that discussion. However, in practice, consultation and collaboration with First Nations may be challenging for a variety of reasons, in particular because it depends on the type of existing relationship between First Nations governments and the provincal government. Where those relationships are generally productive, it may be possible to link into existing discussions and with regional staff to set-up mechanisms for discussing TSR and infringment on rights. However, where those relationships are poor, it may be impossible to initiate those discussions, in which case the standard factors may be used. 

Consultation with First Nations will be conducted as part of the TSR process, and consultation related to wildlife analyses and infringement of rights shoudl happen as part of that process. Thus, a key to htis analysis is close communication with the consultation team involved in each TSR. All consulation and collaboration with First Nations should be documented for the determination factor.
