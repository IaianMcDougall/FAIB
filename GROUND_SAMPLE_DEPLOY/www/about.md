# **Sample Types**

### **Provincial Change Monitoring Inventory (CMI) plots**
Provide statistically-sound, point-in-time and change estimates of vegetation attributes over existing sampled areas of the province with fixed-radius plots located on the 20 km by 20 km NFI grid.

### **Provincial Young Stand Monitoring (YSM) plots**
Monitor the growth and health of young (15-50 years old) stands using fixed-radius plots located on an intensification of the 20 km by 20 km NFI grid.

### **National Forest Inventory (NFI) plots**
A stratified subset of CMI plots that have been selected across national Ecozone boundaries and that contribute towards Canada's National Forest Inventory program.

### **Supplemental Samples (SUP) plots**
Samples on a 10 by 20km grid across the mature population.

### **Permanent Sample Plots (PSP)**
Subjectively located fixed-area permanent plots, valued for their long-term re-measurement data to support development of growth-and-yield models in unmanaged stands across a range of stand and ecosystem types. Also referred to as Growth and Yield (GY) plots.

### **Vegetation Resource Inventory (VRI) plots**
Temporary 5-point cluster plots used to audit and/or adjust photo-interpreted spatial inventory attributes, sampled from area-specific project implementation plans. Also referred to as VRI-phase II ground plots.
